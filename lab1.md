# Lab Report 1

To download Visual Studio Code, go to the website [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). There are different version for Windows and Macs. This is what your screen should look like after opening VS Code upon downloadinh. (It's normal if the recent field it's empty on your screen. Since I used VS code before it automatically shows up the file I ahve opened.)

The next step would be to install git at [Download git](https://gitforwindows.org/)
Open a new terminal in VS Code and type in **$ ssh accountName@ieng6.ucsd.edu**, replace "accountName" with your acount that starts with "cse15l." Type in "yes" to any question that potentially pops up. Finally, enter the password you created for your sccount to complete login.

Your terminal should look similar to the picture below after logged in.

Congratulations! Now you have successfully connected to a computer in CSE Department. From now on, whatever commands you type in will run on the computers at the basement of CSE building. It's the time to try out some commands to see what you will get. For Example:
*cd ~
*pwd
*ls
*ls -lat
*ls -a

And the results you get should look similar to the screenshot below:
